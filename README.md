## Usage

The way you import the `pino` and `@openobserve/pino-openobserve` packages depends on whether you're using `import` or `require`. 

Using `import`:

```javascript
import pino from 'pino';
import OpenobserveTransport from '@openobserve/pino-openobserve';
```

Using `require`:

```javascript
const pino = require('pino');
const OpenobserveTransport = require('@openobserve/pino-openobserve');
```

After importing the necessary packages, you can use this transport with Pino like this:

```javascript
const logger = pino({
  level: 'info',
  transport: {
    target: OpenobserveTransport,
    options: {
      url: 'https://your-openobserve-server.com',
      organization: 'your-organization',
      streamName: 'your-stream',
      auth: {
        username: 'your-username',
        password: 'your-password',
      },
    },
  },
});

logger.info('Hello, world!');
logger.info({ lang: 'js', code: 'Node.js' }, 'Logging with JSON');
```

In this example, the second `logger.info` call logs a JSON object containing the properties `lang` and `code`, along with the message 'Logging with JSON'. This is a common way to include structured data in your logs when using Pino.
